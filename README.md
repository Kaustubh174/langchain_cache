# LangChain Caching LLM Response

## Introduction

In natural language processing and machine learning, caching plays a crucial role in enhancing performance and reducing costs. By storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again, caching helps in avoiding redundant computations. This is particularly important when dealing with large language models (LLMs) like those provided by OpenAI, where each invocation can be time-consuming and costly. This repository demonstrates the use of caching with LangChain, an open-source framework for chaining together different LLM components, to improve efficiency and save costs.

## Function

The primary function of this code is to demonstrate how caching can be integrated into LangChain to store and retrieve LLM responses. By caching the responses, subsequent calls with the same inputs can be served faster and without incurring additional costs.

## Uses of Caching

1. **Performance Improvement**: Caching significantly reduces the response time for repeated queries by avoiding redundant computations.
2. **Cost Savings**: By reusing the results of previous computations, caching helps in reducing the number of API calls to the LLM service, thereby saving costs.
3. **Resource Optimization**: Caching helps in better utilization of computational resources by reducing the load on the LLM service.

## Code Explanation

The provided code demonstrates the use of both in-memory and SQLite caching mechanisms with LangChain.

### In-Memory Caching

In-memory caching stores the results in the system's RAM, providing the fastest access times but with limited storage capacity.
